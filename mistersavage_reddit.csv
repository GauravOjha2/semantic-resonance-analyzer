I also launched a live stage show called Brain Candy with Vsauce's Michael Stevens and a Maker Tour series on Tested.com. 

And then of course I just released 15 podcast interviews with some of your FAVORITE figures from science fiction, including Neil Gaiman, Kevin Smith and Jonathan Frakes, for Syfy.

It came while we were filming an episode about bullets skipping off the pavement and into cars. We had a devil of a time doing such a thing safely, but with the help of our frequent contributor, ballistics expert Alex Jason, we succeeded.

The shoot was a tough one, but once we had all of our data, the result was clear. Alex turned to me and said the quote in question. The SECOND he said it, I told him that I was going to say it on camera, and that it would be a big hit of a phrase. He said that was fine with him. He thinks it's hilarious that it's gone so viral.

"Suggest a Myth (or Item to Blow Up) for the MythBusters: The Reddit Special! You read that right: I'm happy to announce that we're doing MythBusters: The Reddit Special! Yup, we're handing over the editorial of an episode to YOU. So if you've got a TESTABLE myth you want us to tackle, post it below. If you've got a myth you think we messed up and should do again, then put it here in this thread. We are also interested in novel methodologies if you guy have something interesting in that regard too! If you want us to blow something up, here's where you can tell us! Or if you've just got a burning desire to send something weird and wonderful to its doom courtesy of the rocket sled, then you know what to do. (Post it below!)

Basically, we'll tackle the myths you guys have suggested with one obvious caveat - the myths have to be PG-13! We’re definitely up for some fun with stuff like farting, but anything more R-rated than that (and we know how Reddit works) is not going to fly! In two weeks' time, the MythBusters R&D team will trawl through this entire thread and select the myths / stunts / questions / requests that are the best fit for the show, and then we’ll fast-track the episode to a screen near you in early 2016. Happy posting!
