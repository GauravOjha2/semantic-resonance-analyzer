"Happy to clarify this as I can see how it may be confusing. 

I usually had at least one drink a night, typically a couple. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever said I only drank one drink each night. There was a several year period where I‚Äôd go out a couple times a week with friends and have 3-4 drinks then maybe another when I got home. This would be over the course of 4 hours or so. By the time I moved to Seattle and my second child was born in 2021, I‚Äôd typically have at least a drink or two each night, and it was usually beer or wine. At the worst part of my addiction I had hidden bottle of whiskey in the garage which I‚Äôd go take swigs of now and then at night. This added another drink or two per night on average. Sometimes more, some times less.

It was always at least one drink per night though. Until k fully quit I could not go a night without it.

I don‚Äôt think I described any daily hangovers. I didn‚Äôt have daily hangovers. But as I got older the hangovers became more regular and less predictable. Sometimes I‚Äôd get a hangover with just a single drink or two. It didn‚Äôt seem to correlate to the amount I drank.

I‚Äôve had four blackout occasions in my life and one occasion when I didn‚Äôt black out, but passed out. The first was on my 21st birthday when I drank a WHOLE lot. The second was at a restaurant holiday party in my early 20s where I blacked out after my first glass of wine because I had also taken a random pill that another cook offered me. He said it was ecstasy but it definitely wasn‚Äôt. Not sure what it was but I don‚Äôt remember the rest of the night. I was told that I had behaved normally and went to a friend‚Äôs house. I don‚Äôt remember any of it.

The third occasion was in my mid 30s when a similar thing happened: I had a single drink at a bar and don‚Äôt remember the rest of the night. I woke up hours later facedown on a subway platform that was not my line. My wallet was stolen and I had a pounding headache. The friend I was with told me we had one drink, I said good bye, and got onto the subway. I don‚Äôt remember getting on that subway. Again I strongly suspect I was drugged somehow but I really can‚Äôt be sure.

The fourth occasion I‚Äôd prefer not to talk about as it involves other folks whose privacy I won‚Äôt breach, but it was more similar to my 21st birthday where I drank to excess and blocked out because of it.

The pass out occasion I described in the letter was October of 2023 just before I decided to go sober. I had a reedy flight to NY from Seattle. I drank a shot of whiskey and a large beer at the terminal bar before boarding my flight. So a couple of drinks (2.5 technically as the beer was 23 ounces)‚Äînot enough to really mess with me. However at the time I was suffering from some severe stress and anxiety, it was a red eye flight, and I have pre-existing blood pressure issues (my body doesn‚Äôt regulate my blood pressure well so I frequently get light headed and have occasionally fainted when standing up too suddenly).

I fell asleep in my seat and half way through the flight got up suddenly to go to the bathroom. All those things combined with the couple of drinks I had was enough to make me pass out as I walked down the aisle. I fell and banged my head on a beverage cart. From what the flight attendants tell me, I tried to get up several times over the course of a few minutes and each time I‚Äôd stand, I‚Äôd lose blood pressure and faint again.

"Helping the unhoused during the heat wave Hi neighbors. Just a quick note about the heat wave and some ways to help those less fortunate than you. According to a friend who has been working with homeless folks in LA for the past couple of years, the most-requested items during heat waves are:

- bottled water and sports drinks.
- hard candies.
- unsized shoes, such as shower slippers or flip flops (shoeless people are at especially high risk because they cannot enter grocery stores or convenience stores to briefly escape the heat).
- cooling towels (small absorbent hand-towels).
- money for transportation.

If you have the means and opportunity over the next couple days, consider purchasing some of these items and dropping them off at homeless camps, or keeping them in your car to hand out to anyone you see in need.

"Looking for food science writers I'm not sure if this is allowed here, so if it's not, I apologize in advance.

&#x200B;

My friend Priya Krishna (you may know here from the New York Times or the Bon Appetit Youtube channel) is looking for some aspiring food writers with a specific interest in food science to work on a new book that she is putting together with David Chang. If you are interested in home cooking and food science, and think you have the writing skills to explain the science behind everyday things like microwaving, cooking with frozen vegetables, browning, etc, let me know. This is obviously a paid opportunity, and we are specifically looking for black, indigenous, and people of color (though it is open to all).

&#x200B;

Feel free to DM me and I'll forward you to Priya. Thanks!",1592516227.0,AskCulinary
